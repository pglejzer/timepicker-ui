## [3.0.0] - 2025-07-25

### Added

- **New `OptionTypes`**:

  - `inline` mode (`inline.enabled`, `containerId`, `showButtons`, `autoUpdate`)
  - `cssClass` – allows adding custom class to wrapper
  - New themes: `ai`, `cyberpunk`, `glassmorphic`, `pastel`, `dark`, `m3`

- **New Callback API**:

  - `onConfirm`, `onCancel`, `onOpen`, `onUpdate`, `onSelectHour`, `onSelectMinute`, `onSelectAM`, `onSelectPM`, `onError`

- **New DOM events** (replacing old ones):

  - `timepicker:open`, `timepicker:confirm`, `timepicker:cancel`, `timepicker:update`, `timepicker:error`, `timepicker:select-hour`, etc.

- **TypeScript types**: Full typings via `OptionTypes`, `TimepickerUI`, event payloads
- **Public API methods**: `.create()`, `.open()`, `.close()`, `.update()`, `.destroy()`, `.getValue()`, `.setValue()`

### Changed
